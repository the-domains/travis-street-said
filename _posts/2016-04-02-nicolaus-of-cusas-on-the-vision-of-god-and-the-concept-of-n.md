## Notable Notes

\`\`Those who argue that the universe is entropic, do so because, like Aristotle, they deny that man is capable of elevating his mind above inductive and deductive forms of discursive rationality to the level of creative intellect.''

\`\`My being is such that it can make itself more and more capable of receiving...grace and goodness. And this power, which I have from...(the infinite)... by virtue of which I possess a living image... omnipotent power... (manifest in)... free will.''

\`\`Entropy exists in the same way that evil exists. It has no positive being, and therefore only exists to the extent that man, through the misuse of his free will, departs from the good. Rather than being a law of the universe, entropy is the evil consequence of man's decision to decrease his capability of receiving the grace and goodness of ...(the infinite).''

\`\`Cusanus then concludes: \`So let the concept of a clock be, as it were, eternity itself. Then, in the clock, movement is succession. Therefore, eternity enfolds and unfolds succession, for the Concept of a clock--a Concept which is eternity--both enfolds and unfolds all things.''

\`\`Let us describe a circle, _bc_, which is being rotated about a point _a _as would the upper circle of a top; and let there be another fixed circle, _de_: Is it not true that the faster the movable circle is rotated, the less it seems to be moved?'' (An early frontispiece of Cusa's _On Learned Ignorance.)_

## Nicolaus of Cusa's "On The Vision Of God",  
and the Concept of Negentropy

William F. Wertz, contributing editor of "Executive Intelligence Review" magazine and a member of the executive committee of the National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC), addressed the Labor Day Conference of the Schiller Institute and NCLC on September 5\. The text of his presentation follows.

> The purpose of my presentation today is to discuss the concept of negentropy expressed by Nicolaus of Cusa in his book, so that we might better master the ideas necessary to reverse the entropy which will otherwise engulf America by the year 2000, if not earlier. In a recent paper entitled "The Challenge for the Human Race: A Mission Task Orientation to Develop Science Beyond Its Current Limits", Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. wrote:

''I suggest that we look at the famous work by Nicolaus of Cusa, his _[On the Vision of God][1]. _Cusanus reaches the same definition of what I have called _negentropy _as I defined in 1952\. That is, the notion, for example, in an economic process, that a viable economic process is one in which the per capita and per hectare or per square kilometer energy of the system, that is, of the economic social reproductive system, is increasing but that at the same time, the relative free energy to energy of the system, is also increasing. That kind of system, and organizations which correspond to that kind of system, are what I term the _phenom_en_a _to which the term negentropy is properly applied, rejecting the definition of negentropy which is derived from the negative H theorem, that is, from the [Boltzmann conception of negative entropy][2].''

> LaRouche continues:

''So throw out negative entropy as a definition of the phenomenon to which the term negentropy is often applied, and go to the biological definition of the phenomenon of life. What we mean by the difference between _living _and _non-living _processes defines for us the difference between what we call _negentropic _and _entropic _phenomena. The term entropy and the term negentropy, should be regarded as attempts to supply terms which we would then seek to explain, for the difference between living and dying or dead processes.''

> LaRouche concludes:

''In _[On the Vision of God][1], _Cusanus outlines a development of species in this way, that essentially if one were to describe what Cusanus is saying in _[On the Vision of God][1], _one would say that he is defining species, or a succession of species, which are distinguished in their succession, by an increase of the energy of the system per individual and in respect to nature per capita, per square kilometer, or per hectare per square kilometer, while at the same time the ratio of free energy to energy of the system, is being increased.''

The notion that the universe is characterized by the principle of maximization of entropy based on the First and Second laws of Thermodynamics and that any apparent exception to this principle referred to as negative entropy ultimately results in an increase in entropy, is a pseudo-scientific conception which, if it becomes dominant in the thinking of any society, as it has become in large part today, results necessarily in the death of that society due to its inability to increase its potential relative population density.

The increase in potential relative population density which the human species has experienced as a result of the Council of Florence in 1439-40 is directly attributable to the opposing, actually scientific view that the universe is characterized by a principle of negentropy and that man as the highest expression of the negentropic development of the universe is capable of continuing the creative development of the universe insofar as he is in the living image of...(the infinite).

The [neo-Malthusians][3] view this increase in potential relative population density as negative entropy, that is, as a violation of the principle of entropy. According to their view, the world's population must be reduced and industrial development curbed, not in order to prevent the entropic exhaustion and death of the universe, which they regard as inevitable, but merely to postpone it. Theirs is not a culture of life, but rather a culture of death based on non-living processes.

If this cultural paradigm is to be reversed, we must ground ourselves in the opposing negentropic conception of life as expressed by Nicholas of Cusa in _[On the Vision of God][4]_, written in 1453, and in a number of his other works.

## The Concept of Evolution

Today, the very concept of evolution gives rise to a false debate between the Darwinian materialist conception of evolution and a creationist conception based upon a literal interpretation of the Bible. However, in his writings, Nicolaus of Cusa presented what can only be described as a Christian concept of evolution.

The idea that God's creation of the universe does not contradict the concept of evolution is not original to Cusanus. St. Augustine put forward such a conception in his commentary _On Genesis_, in which he argued that all things that are generated take their origin and development, each in its proper time, from the original principles or seminal reasons of things which God placed in them. (_[The Essential Augustine][5]_, p. 103)

In _[On the Vision of God][1], _Cusanus uses the example of a nut tree to demonstrate that if we want to know the essence of a created thing, we must ascend in our mind's eye from the visible domain to its First Cause in the invisible domain. He takes this approach based upon the Apostle Paul's statement in [Romans 1:20][6] that, "Ever since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes of eternal power and divinity have been able to be understood and perceived in what he has made."

Cusanus argues:

> If I seek the power and beginning of a nut tree which I see with the sensible eye, I must look with my mind's eye to see that the tree existed potentially in its seed. However, since the seed has power only with respect to this species of nuts, I must reflect upon the entire seminal power of all the trees of various species. If, then, I wish to see the Absolute Power of all the powers of such seeds, I must pass beyond all seminal power to the Beginning, which gives being to every power, whether seminal or non-seminal.
> 
> This absolute and super-exalted Power gives to each seminal power the power whereby it enfolds a tree potentially, together with all that is required for a sensible tree and all that follows from the being of a tree. Accordingly, this Beginning and Cause has within itself--as Cause, and in an absolute and enfolded manner--whatever it gives to the effect. In this way I see that this Power is the Face, or Exemplar, of every arboreal species and of each tree. In this Power I see this nut tree not as in its own contracted seminal potency but as in the Cause and Maker of that seminal power. And so, I see that this tree is a certain unfolding of the seed's power and that the seed is a certain unfolding of Omnipotent Power (p. 143, [On the Vision of God][1], [Nicholas of Cusa][0]).[][7]
> 
> [][7]
> 
> Moreover, I see that in the seed the tree is not a tree but is the seminal power, and the seminal power is that from which the tree is unfolded, so that in the tree there can be present only what proceeds from the seed's power. Similarly, in its own Cause, which is the Power of powers, the seminal power is not seminal power, but is Absolute Power. And so, in You my God the tree is You Yourself my God; and in You it is the Truth and Exemplar of itself. Likewise, too, in You the seed of the tree is the Truth and Exemplar of itself. Of both the tree and the seed You, O God, are the Truth and Exemplar'' (p. 145, [On the Vision of God,][1][Nicholas of Cusa][0]).

In this discussion of the nut tree, Cusanus puts forward the idea that all creation is enfolded eternally in God as Cause and unfolded in time as effect. God, therefore, both transcends the universe and is present in it. Since all things were made through the Word, the Word is present in all things. Or as Cusanus writes in

_[On the Vision of God][8]_

\`\`Since... (the infinite)... is the Absolute Form of all form-able forms... (this infinite) enfolds in ..(itself)... the forms of all things'' (p. 123). Since... (the infinite)... is the Absolute Being of all things,.. (it)... is present to each and every thing... (The infinite)... is not the universe, as a pantheist would argue, because... (it)... precedes the universe, which...(is)... created. (The infinite)... is \`\`all in all'', therefore, in such a way that...(it)... is nothing of everything. Thus, although... (the infinite)... is not a creature and therefore cannot be seen by the sensible eye,.. (it)... is nonetheless the invisible Cause and Essence of each and every creature, a concept which Cusanus locates as expressed by the [Apostle Paul][9] who wrote... ''(God) is before all things, and in Him all things hold together'' ([Col 1:17][10]), that God is \`\`all in all'' ([1 Cor 15:28][11]) and that \`\`God is not far from us, for we are in Him and we are moved'' ([Acts 17:27-28][12]).

The creature does not exist through itself, but rather derives its specific form from the Form which exists through itself. Therefore, if we wish to know the Nature of the creature, we must see the invisible in the visible, the cause in the effect, the truth and exemplar in the image.

Those who argue that the universe is entropic, do so because, like Aristotle, they deny that man is capable of elevating his mind above inductive and deductive forms of discursive rationality to the level of creative intellect. Because Aristotelian logic defines as its first principle the law of contradiction, it rejects as impossible the coincidence of opposites, such as the idea expressed by Cusanus in _[On Learned Ignorance][13]_that \`\`every created thing is, as it were, a finite infinity or a created god'' (p. 93), in contradistinction to God the Creator, Who is Absolute infinity and uncreated. But to arrive at a true understanding of the laws of the universe, and to enter Paradise, as Cusanus writes in_On the Vision of God_, one must vanquish the \`\`lofty rational spirit'' (p. 161) of Aristotelian logic, which guards the gate of the wall of Paradise.

Today we hear a lot about a concept of self-realization, according to which man divorced from God reduces himself to a bestial state. However, Cusanus argues that for man to truly realize his potential, he must rise to the level of being an adopted son of God. Since man is created in the image of God, he can only be his true self to the extent he conforms to his own Cause and Exemplar. When God says to Cusanus: \`\`Be your own and I will be yours'' (p. 147), Cusanus understands that to mean that we are our own true selves, when the senses serve reason and we are in harmony with the Word.

When we rise to the level of creative intellect, then we are capable of seeing that the universe is not entropic, but rather unfolds negentropically, precisely because it is enfolded in God, Who is eternal.

One of the major obstacles to conceptualizing how God could have created the universe out of nothing in eternity which precedes time and how at the same time it can be said that the universe evolves in time, is the tendency to view eternity from the standpoint of succession. But as Cusanus points out: \`\`Now, posterior to most simple eternity no thing can possibly be made. Therefore, infinite duration, which is eternity itself, encompasses all succession. Therefore, everything which appears to us in a succession is not at all posterior to Your Concept, which is eternity. For Your one Concept, which is also Your Word, enfolds each and everything ... all things exist because You conceive them. Now, You conceive in eternity. But in eternity succession is--without succession--eternity itself, i.e., Your Word itself, O Lord God. Any given thing that appears to us in time was not conceived by You before it existed. For in eternity, in which You conceive, all temporal succession coincides in one and the same now of eternity. Therefore, where the future and the past coincide with the present, nothing is past or future'' (p. 167).
