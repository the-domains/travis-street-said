## Notable Notes

\`\`Those who argue that the universe is entropic, do so because, like Aristotle, they deny that man is capable of elevating his mind above inductive and deductive forms of discursive rationality to the level of creative intellect.''

\`\`My being is such that it can make itself more and more capable of receiving...grace and goodness. And this power, which I have from...(the infinite)... by virtue of which I possess a living image of... omnipotent power...(manifest in)... free will.''

\`\`Entropy exists in the same way that evil exists. It has no positive being, and therefore only exists to the extent that man, through the misuse of his free will, departs from the good. Rather than being a law of the universe, entropy is the evil consequence of man's decision to decrease his capability of receiving the grace and goodness of ...(the infinite).''

\`\`Cusanus then concludes: \`So let the concept of a clock be, as it were, eternity itself. Then, in the clock, movement is succession. Therefore, eternity enfolds and unfolds succession, for the Concept of a clock--a Concept which is eternity--both enfolds and unfolds all things.'|''

\`\`Let us describe a circle,_bc_, which is being rotated about a point_a_as would the upper circle of a top; and let there be another fixed circle,_de_: Is it not true that the faster the movable circle is rotated, the less it seems to be moved?''

## Nicolaus of Cusa's "On The Vision Of God",  
and the Concept of Negentropy

William F. Wertz, contributing editor of "Executive Intelligence Review" magazine and a member of the executive committee of the National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC), addressed the Labor Day Conference of the Schiller Institute and NCLC on September 5\. The text of his presentation follows.

> The purpose of my presentation today is to discuss the concept of negentropy expressed by Nicolaus of Cusa in his book, so that we might better master the ideas necessary to reverse the entropy which will otherwise engulf America by the year 2000, if not earlier. In a recent paper entitled "The Challenge for the Human Race: A Mission Task Orientation to Develop Science Beyond Its Current Limits", Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. wrote:

I suggest that we look at the famous work by Nicolaus of Cusa, his _On the Vision of God. _Cusanus reaches the same definition of what I have called _negentropy _as I defined in 1952\. That is, the notion, for example, in an economic process, that a viable economic process is one in which the per capita and per hectare or per square kilometer energy of the system, that is, of the economic social reproductive system, is increasing but that at the same time, the relative free energy to energy of the system, is also increasing. That kind of system, and organizations which correspond to that kind of system, are what I term the _phenom_en_a _to which the term negentropy is properly applied, rejecting the definition of negentropy which is derived from the negative H theorem, that is, from the Boltzmann conception of negative entropy.''

> LaRouche continues:

So throw out negative entropy as a definition of the phenomenon to which the term negentropy is often applied, and go to the biological definition of the phenomenon of life. What we mean by the difference between _living _and _non-living _processes defines for us the difference between what we call _negentropic _and _entropic _phenomena. The term entropy and the term negentropy, should be regarded as attempts to supply terms which we would then seek to explain, for the difference between living and dying or dead processes.''

> LaRouche concludes:

In _On the Vision of God, _Cusanus outlines a development of species in this way, that essentially if one were to describe what Cusanus is saying in _On the Vision of God, _one would say that he is defining species, or a succession of species, which are distinguished in their succession, by an increase of the energy of the system per individual and in respect to nature per capita, per square kilometer, or per hectare per square kilometer, while at the same time the ratio of free energy to energy of the system, is being increased.''

The notion that the universe is characterized by the principle of maximization of entropy based on the First and Second laws of Thermodynamics and that any apparent exception to this principle referred to as negative entropy ultimately results in an increase in entropy, is a pseudo-scientific conception which, if it becomes dominant in the thinking of any society, as it has become in large part today, results necessarily in the death of that society due to its inability to increase its potential relative population density.

The increase in potential relative population density which the human species has experienced as a result of the Council of Florence in 1439-40 is directly attributable to the opposing, actually scientific view that the universe is characterized by a principle of negentropy and that man as the highest expression of the negentropic development of the universe is capable of continuing the creative development of the universe insofar as he is in the living image of...(the infinite).

The neo-Malthusians view this increase in potential relative population density as negative entropy, that is, as a violation of the principle of entropy. According to their view, the world's population must be reduced and industrial development curbed, not in order to prevent the entropic exhaustion and death of the universe, which they regard as inevitable, but merely to postpone it. Theirs is not a culture of life, but rather a culture of death based on non-living processes.

If this cultural paradigm is to be reversed, we must ground ourselves in the opposing negentropic conception of life as expressed by Nicolaus of Cusa in _On the Vision of God_, written in 1453, and in a number of his other works.
